# photogallery

I'm mostly familiar with using express as a server scaffolding so I started from an React and Express template I'm familiar with. 
I spent about 3 hours on this including troubleshooting some server and dev environment issues. I didn't spend too much time on styling because I
was more interested in writing the server functions. Also, the mockup didn't provide that much in terms of visuals. I think I got it to resemble the sketch pretty well.
Most of my added dependancies were regarding backend functionality. I think it is within the bounds 
of the prompt because it seemed like a the backend was optional anyway. 

Going forward it would be nice to update the code to process multiple photos at once (interface allows for selection of multiple but only one is processed). 
In that vein, a progress meter / loading image would be nice while the file(s) are processing. More error checking in general on the server side would be great too.
More personalization on the server side would be interesting to: individual user folders with password checking.
Better UI for the deletion function would be fun too: something like a small trash can icon appears in the upper right of the image on hover. And also a delete image 
comfirmation dialog. Overall it was fun to do a true full stack application.
